abstract="AUTOMATH is a language intended for expressing detailed mathematical thoughts. It is not a programming language, although it has several features in common with existing programming languages. It is defined by a grammar, and every text written according to its rules is claimed to correspond to correct mathematics. It can be used to express a large part (see 1.6) of mathematics, and admits many ways for laying the foundations. The rules are such that a computer can be instructed to check whether texts written in the language are correct. These texts are not restricted to proofs of single theorems; they can contain entire mathematical theories, including the rules of inference used in such theories.",

Resolution theorem provers are automatic and powerful, but they are designed to be used for very different applications.

In particular, we present a sound and practical encoding in first-order logic of Isabelle's type classes.",

	abstract="We describe a formalization of the elementary algebra, topology and analysis of finite-dimensional Euclidean space in the HOL Light theorem prover. (Euclidean space is {\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathbb R{\}}^{\{}N{\}}{\$}with the usual notion of distance.) A notable feature is that the HOL type system is used to encode the dimension N in a simple and useful way, even though HOL does not permit dependent types. In the resulting theory the HOL type system, far from getting in the way, naturally imposes the correct dimensional constraints, e.g. checking compatibility in matrix multiplication. Among the interesting later developments of the theory are a partial decision procedure for the theory of vector spaces (based on a more general algorithm due to Solovay) and a formal proof of various classic theorems of topology and analysis for arbitrary N-dimensional Euclidean space, e.g. Brouwer's fixpoint theorem and the differentiability of inverse functions.",

	abstract="We propose a new tactic language for the system Coq, which is intended to enrich the current tactic combinators (tacticals). This language is based on a functional core with recursors and matching operators for Coq terms but also for proof contexts. It can be used directly in proof scripts or in toplevel definitions (tactic definitions). We show that the implementation of this language involves considerable changes in the interpretation of proof scripts, essentially due to the matching operators. We give some examples which solve small proof parts locally and some others which deal with non-trivial problems. Finally, we discuss the status of this meta-language with respect to the Coq language and the implementation language of Coq.",
